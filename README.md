# StckUtils

This is a Challenge Plugin inspired by [BUtils](https://banko.tv/plugin) by [DerBanko](https://banko.tv) <br>
I started this Project mainly for [EditorStyles](https://twitch.tv/editorstyles) but probably other people will use this
plugin too

## How to use

### Features

Have a look [here](guide/Features.md)

### Installing

> Skip Steps 1 and 2 if you already have a Paper (or Paper based) server.

1. Create a [Paper](https://papermc.io) (or Paper based) server.
2. Start the server, accept the Minecraft eula, then start it again.
3. Download the `stckutils-x.x.x.jar` from
   the [latest release](https://github.com/StckOverflwNet/StckUtils/releases/latest).
4. Place the `stckutils-x.x.x.jar` in the plugins Folder of the server.
5. Restart the server (please don't reload, genereally reloading is a bad thing and you should always choose a clean
   restart over a messy reload)
6. Give yourself op by sending `op <your-minecraft-name>` in the console (If you use a permissions plugin have a look
   [here](guide/Features.md#permissions) for the permissions)
